          <h1>Freelance Orders</h1>
          <p>
            <b>Freelance Orders</b> are independent organizations of
            adventurers, scholars, warriors, and survivalists that operate
            beyond the confines of any single city or nation, often across the
            vast and varied lands of <i>Ruaneia</i>. United by shared values,
            specialized expertise, or a common mission, each Free Company
            pursues goals that align with its distinct ideals and objectives.
            While they are often welcomed for their skills, some view them with
            suspicion due to their autonomy and influence.
            <br />
            Members of Freelance Orders frequently undertake tasks such as
            exploration, the preservation of ancient lore, the pursuit of
            mystical artifacts, and the safeguarding of remote or perilous
            regions. Though each company is different, they all share a degree
            of independence from local politics, making them invaluable allies,
            yet unpredictable forces in the world's affairs. Some are well-known
            for their altruism, while others might be more enigmatic or
            self-serving.

            <h3>Sandguard</h3>
            <p>
              The Sandguard is a faction of desert-born warriors, scholars, and
              survivalists committed to protecting the delicate balance of the
              Sharras'Thar desert and the lands surrounding it. They serve as
              guides, researchers, and protectors, standing against reckless
              efforts to exploit the desert's resources, believing such actions
              could disturb ancient powers like the legendary Calamity of the
              Dunes. <br />
              The Sandguard has established their headquarters in Shar'Mazir,
              where they openly provide guidance and expertise to travellers,
              and traders, but they remain vigilant in their opposition to
              expansions that are harmful to the environment.
            </p>
            <h4>Core Values</h4>
            <p>
              <b><i>Balance with the Desert.</i></b> The Sandguard seeks to
              maintain harmony with the desert ecosystem, preventing its
              disruption.
              <br />
              <b><i>Knowledge and Wisdom.</i></b> Understanding the desert's
              secrets is key to protecting it. The faction values research and
              desert lore. <br />
              <b><i>Protection and Guidance.</i></b> Skilled in both combat and
              survival, the Sandguard protects travellers and defends cities
              against desert threats.
