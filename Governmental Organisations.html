              <h3>Council of Cliffs</h3>
              <p>
                The Council of the Cliffs, is a group of powerful oligarchs,
                each representing an influential faction, family, or guild
                within the city. Originally, the council was formed by the
                city's founders—warriors, engineers, and scholars—who built
                Shar'Mazir to protect the northern lands from the desert and
                Zar'Khul. Over time, as the immediate threat of the World Eater
                faded into legend, the council shifted its focus from defence
                and survival to politics, wealth, and power. In memory of its
                original purpose the council is still made up of five seats: one
                for each of the four major parties involved in the founding of
                Shar'Mazir—the Water Lords, the Iron Watch, the Merchant Guild
                and the Arcane Collective—and one Free Seat elected each year as
                a tiebreaker. As whispers of unrest and forgotten legends begin
                to resurface, the council remains preoccupied with their
                schemes, blind to the awakening darkness beyond the dunes.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h4>Water Lords</h4>
              <p>
                The Water Lords control the aqueducts and the distribution of
                water within Shar'Mazir and its immediate surroundings. Once
                contributing the lifeblood of Shar'Mazir and a main driving
                force of prosperity and wealth in the area, with the danger of
                Zar'Khul long lost to myth, many of the Water Lords have shifted
                their focus toward their personal gain. Envious of the Merchant
                Guilds increasing wealth and influence, they have begun
                implementing tight rations of water as political leverage and to
                collect exorbitant prices for additional water supplies. <br />
                However, their greed comes at a cost. In an effort to cut
                expenses and manpower, the western aqueduct, stretching through
                increasingly dangerous regions, has fallen into disrepair. The
                declining water quality is driving commoners to abandon their
                fields and seek less legitimate means of income, resulting in
                food shortages and rising crime rates throughout the city.
              </p>
              <h4>Iron Watch</h4>
              <p>
                The Iron Watch once stood as a proud and disciplined military
                force, defending Shar'Mazir and the northern lands from the
                terrors of Zar'Khul and other dangers emerging from the southern
                desert of Sharras'Thar. However, those glory days have long
                since passed. What remains is little more than a city guard and
                a handful of mercenary companies still on the city's payroll.
                Once noble protectors, they now primarily serve as guards for
                hire, enforcing the will of the highest bidder rather than
                upholding the city's common good. <br />
                Corruption runs deep within the ranks, with commanders more
                concerned with political favors and personal enrichment than
                upholding the values of their predecessors. Though the Iron
                Watch still nominally guards the towering walls that stretch
                between the western and eastern mountain passes, they've grown
                lax, their forces spread thin, and many of their patrols
                neglected. <br />
                This negligence has allowed monsters, bandits, and pillagers to
                establish themselves along the once-safe trade routes, causing
                travel and commerce to falter. While their council pays little
                attention to the growing danger, pockets of resistance remain
                within the Iron Watch—veterans who remember the ideals they once
                stood for, and younger recruits disillusioned by the corruption
                they've inherited. These internal factions quietly struggle for
                control, torn between restoring the Iron Watch's honor or
                succumbing entirely to the highest bidder's whims.
              </p>
              <h4>Merchant Guild</h4>
              <p>
                The Merchant Guild controls all trade, taxation, and tariffs on
                goods passing through Shar'Mazir, especially along the trade
                routes that cut through the desert of Sharras'Thar and the
                treacherous mountain passes of Khar'Zhatyr in the west and
                Dur'Akhar in the east. Their relentless focus on profit has
                driven them to develop innovative methods of transportation,
                most notably the Sand Skiff—vessels capable of gliding across
                the desert sands as ships do on the sea. These skiffs allow the
                Merchant Guild to dominate desert trade routes, giving them a
                near-monopoly on goods flowing through the region. <br />
                Constantly seeking to expand their influence, the guild actively
                establishes new trade hubs along their routes, consolidating
                wealth and power with each new outpost. Their control over
                Shar'Mazir's economy is absolute as they manipulate the market
                through artificial scarcity, strategic monopolies, and high
                tariffs, justifying their exorbitant prices by citing the
                unpredictable dangers of desert travel. <br />
                Many suspect the guild of exaggerating the dangers of the desert
                to maintain their grip on wealth, while others suffer under
                their inflated prices. Politically, the Merchant Guild wields
                considerable influence in the Council of the Cliffs, often using
                their wealth to sway votes or undermine rivals.
              </p>
              <h4>Arcane Collective</h4>
              <p>
                The Arcane Collective is tasked with overseeing all magical and
                technological advancements in Shar'Mazir. Unlike the other
                factions, the Collective has mostly stayed true to its original
                mission: using knowledge and arcane power to safeguard and
                uplift the common people of the city. <br />
                The Arcane Collective's members are scholars, mages, and
                engineers united by a belief in the value of shared knowledge
                and responsible innovation. They regulate the safe use of magic
                within the city and work tirelessly to improve daily life in
                Shar'Mazir. However, despite their dedication, the Arcane
                Collective is under constant pressure. Both the Merchant Guild
                and the Water Lords seek control over their discoveries, hoping
                to monetize and monopolize them. The Iron Watch often sees their
                regulations as a limitation to their autonomy, occasionally
                bypassing imposed restrictions for their own benefit. <br />
                With growing tensions in the city, the Arcane Collective stands
                at a crossroads. They must balance their role as guardians of
                knowledge with the political maneuvering required to defend
                their independence and autonomy. In a city where everyone seems
                to have a price, they remain the last uncorrupted institution, a
                fragile beacon of hope amid the encroaching darkness.
              </p>
              <h4>Free Seat</h4>
              <p>
                The Free Seat is a unique position on the Council of the Cliffs,
                determined each year during a public event known as the Day of
                Blades. On this day, representatives from the Freelance
                Orders—independent mercenary and adventurer groups that operate
                across Ruaneia—along with any ambitious citizen, vie for a
                coveted role in city governance. This intense competition draws
                spectators from across Shar'Mazir, transforming the Day of
                Blades into both a celebration and a high-stakes political
                spectacle. <br />
                Once seated, the Free Seat representative acts as the council's
                tiebreaker for the year. Holding this power makes the Free Seat
                an attractive asset for the city's entrenched factions. Although
                intended to offer a voice to the people and the independent
                spirit of Ruaneia, the Free Seat has often fallen under the
                influence of the four established council members, who eagerly
                sponsor or pressure candidates to secure their votes.
                Technically, any council faction may occupy or control the Free
                Seat through a proxy or allied representative, resulting in
                strategic alliances or intense rivalries each year as factions
                attempt to sway the selection process in their favour. <br />
                For ambitious Freelance Orders members, winning the Free Seat is
                a chance to gain influence in the city. Yet, it is also a
                dangerous role, as council members do not take kindly to
                dissenting votes. Many previous Free Seat holders have been
                found embroiled in scandal, quietly removed from power, or met
                with unfortunate "accidents" when they resisted factional
                pressure. Despite the risks, the Free Seat remains one of the
                only paths to influence in Shar'Mazir for those not born into
                the city's power structure, a symbol of hope for the ambitious
                and the commoners alike.
