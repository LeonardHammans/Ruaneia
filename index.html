          <h1>What makes <i>Ruaneia</i> unique?</h1>
          <h2>Aether engulfs the world of Ruaneia.</h2>
          <p>
            Aether is a mysterious energy older than the world itself,
            surrounding the known universe. Magic and Monsters are believed to
            originate from the Aether. In very rare cases, humanoids are born
            with a touch of Aether, giving them higher aptitudes for magic,
            enhancing their physical prowess and making them more resilient to
            injuries and illnesses. The first record of such an Aetherborn dates
            back several thousands years, and yet little is known about the
            Aether itself or what causes the birth of Aetherborns.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Player Characters are Aetherborn.</h2>
          <p>
            Faintly touched by the mysterious Aether, the characters are capable
            of feats that would not be possible for average humanoids. Many
            people revere Aetherborns in high esteem, seeing them as saviours or
            protectors from the threats of the world. However, others see their
            connection to a vastly mysterious and potentially dangerous source
            of energy, as a threat and seek to rid the world of such
            abominations.
