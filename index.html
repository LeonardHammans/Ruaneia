          <h1>What makes <i>Ruaneia</i> unique?</h1>
          <h2>Aether engulfs the world of Ruaneia.</h2>
          <p>
            Aether is a mysterious energy older even than the gods of the world
            itself, surrounding the known universe. Magic and Monsters are
            believed to originate from the Aether. In very rare cases, humanoids
            are born with a touch of Aether, giving them higher aptitudes for
            magic, enhancing their physical prowess and making them more
            resilient to injuries and illnesses. The first record of such an
            Aetherborn dates back several thousands of years, and yet little is
            known about the Aether itself or about what causes the birth of
            Aetherborns.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Player Characters are Aetherborn.</h2>
          <p>
            Faintly touched by the mysterious Aether, the characters are capable
            of feats that would not be possible for average humanoids. Many
            people revere Aetherborns in high esteem, seeing them as saviours or
            protectors from the threats of the world. However, others see their
            connection to a vastly mysterious and potentially dangerous source
            of energy, as a threat and seek to rid the world of such
            abominations.
            <br />
            <b>Mechanical Changes.</b> Player Characters (PCs), as Aetherborn,
            can exceed a level cap that non-Aetherborn cannot. This level cap
            can be assumed to be somewhere between levels 7 and 12, due to the
            fact that in some rare cases, through exhaustive training and
            deication, people are able to reach heights that are deemed
            impossible for non-Aetherborn.
            <br />
            The magical nature of the Aether lets PCs recover faster from
            injuries, fully healing within a good nights rest, rather than over
            the course of several days and only under supervision of doctors and
            healers or through the administering of medicines. Further, this
            magical aptitude allows any PC to cast
            <i>Spell Scrolls</i> without the need for prior knowledge of the
            enscribed spell. And decreases the time it takes to consume a potion
            and wait for its effect.
